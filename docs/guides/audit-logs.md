# Audit Logs

FastPKI maintains an immutable audit log for every security-sensitive action. Audit log entries are append-only — they cannot be modified or deleted through the API.

## Query Audit Logs

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool
```

**Required role:** Admin or Superuser. Regular users (`USER` role) cannot access audit logs.

- **Superusers** see all audit logs across the system.
- **Admins** see only logs for their own organization.

## Filtering

All filters are optional query parameters and can be combined.

```bash
# Filter by action type
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/?action=ca_create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool

# Filter by user
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/?user_id=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool

# Filter by resource
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/?resource_type=certificate&resource_id=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool

# Filter by date range
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/?since=2025-01-01T00:00:00&until=2025-02-01T00:00:00" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool

# Pagination
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit-logs/?skip=0&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python -m json.tool
```
