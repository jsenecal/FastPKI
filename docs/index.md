# FastPKI

**API-based PKI management system — an easier alternative to Easy-RSA.**

FastPKI lets you create and manage Certificate Authorities, issue certificates, and revoke them through a RESTful API. It supports full CA hierarchies, CRL generation, organization-based multi-tenancy, and role-based access control.
